\chapter{Introduction}

\section{SRS Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of iSport. It will explain the purpose and features of iSport, the interfaces of the iSport, the functional and nonfunctional requirements of iSport, what iSport will do, and the constraints under which it must operate and how the system will react to external stimuli. This document is intended for both the stakeholders and the developers of the system and will be proposed to the clients for its approval.
%This SRS (Software Requirements Specification) document aims to identify the product--iSport whose software requirements are specified in this 
%document, including the revision or release number. And the scope of iSport is covered by this SRS, too, particularly if this SRS describes only 
%part of the system or a single subsystem.$>$

\section{Product Scope}
This software system will be a web based system for sports fans, professional athletes, and patients who are under recovering training. \\
\\
This system will be designed to maximize the exercising efficiency by providing tools to assist in checking and correcting user's wrong postures and recommending training courses customized for users, which would otherwise have to be expensive, time-consuming and labor intensive. By maximizing the user’s training efficiency and convenience the system will meet the needs of sports fans, athletes and injured patients while remaining easy to understand and use.\\
\\
More specifically, this system is designed to allow a user to imitate the standard exercising postures while observe and correct their mistakes simultaneously with the help of a website. \\
\\
The software will collect some professional courses in the database, including static and dynamic trainings which means doing exercise according to a set of images or a video and iSport will recommend suitable trainings for users on the basis of their training performance. Courses are classified into exercising courses and recovering courses, aiming to help athletes and patients respectively.\\
\\
Both visual and audio notification are used in every course of the system to provide eye-catching, user-friendly and clear instructions; the feedback of one's training is proposed once the training is over and the report can be browsed in the report page.\\
\\
The selection and deletion of one user's favorable course is supported in personal information webpage and one can comment training he/she has taken on comment webpage to provide suggestions to other users.\\
\\
 The personal information registering, changes is allowed via the application options. The system also contains a relational database containing a list of users, training images and videos.

\section{Intended Audience}
This Software Requirements document is intended for:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Developers who can review project’s capabilities and more easily understand where their efforts should be targeted to improve or add more features to it (design and code the application – it sets the guidelines for future development).
	\item Project testers can use this document as a base for their testing strategy as some bugs are easier to find using a requirements document. This way testing becomes more methodically organized.
   \item End users of this application who wish to read about what this project can do.
   \item Clients who delegate the software development to our team, and can check if their requirements are perfectly understood by the developers and whether the functional and nonfunctional requirements are entirely meet. And they can modify some requirements according to this document in later stage. 
   \item Project managers who translate the clients' requirement to the programmers and supervise them to implement the requirements mentioned in the documents and if the clients modify the requirements, the project managers have to negotiate the changes with the clients and modify the document.
   \item Marketing staff who are responsible to sale and prompt the software should be clear about what iSport can do, what iSport's advantages are, what iSport's competitive power is.
   \item Service staff who are responsible to solve the customer's problems, they have to know what iSport can do and feedback the technical problems to developers.
   \item Document writers who are responsible for writing the rest documents in later development stages should follow the requirements specified in this SRS.
\end{itemize}
The rest part of this SRS document contains the overall description of iSport, and iSport's specific, nonfunctional and other requirements which are shown in chapter\ref{Overall Description}, chapter\ref{Specific Requirements}, chapter\ref{Other Nonfunctional Requirements} and chapter\ref{Other Requirements} respectively.
We suggest the readers begin with the overview sections and proceeding through the sections that are most pertinent to them:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Developers and project testers are recommended to focus on specific and nonfunctional requirements part because theses parts will lead them to build qualified, safe and satisfying application and theses parts are all related to coding (construction and verification stage).
	\item Clients, project managers and document writers should focus on the entire document since they are responsible for all the requirements specified in this paper.
	\item Marketing staff have to focus on the functional part of iSport.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Overall Description}
\label{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
$<$Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS.  
For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product 
family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained 
product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the 
requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and 
identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major 
components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external 
interfaces can be helpful.$>$

\section{Product Functionality}
$<$Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user 
perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary 
(such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them 
understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of 
related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram 
or object class diagram, is often effective.$>$

\section{Users and Characteristics}
$<$Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product.  
User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product 
functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational 
level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class.  
Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the 
most important user classes for this product from those who are less important 
to satisfy.$>$

\section{Operating Environment}
$<$Describe the environment in which the software will operate, including the 
hardware platform, operating system and versions, and any other software 
components or applications with which it must peacefully coexist.$>$

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
$<$Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the 
developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware 
limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other 
applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel 
operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security 
considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the 
customer’s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered 
software).$>$

\section{User Documentation}
$<$List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help, 
and tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software. Identify any 
known user documentation delivery formats or standards.$>$

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}

$<$List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the 
requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial 
components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating 
environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions 
are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the 
project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to 
reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for 
example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).$>$
