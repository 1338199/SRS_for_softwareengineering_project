\chapter{Introduction}

\section{SRS Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of iSport. It will explain the purpose and features of iSport, the interfaces of the iSport, the functional and nonfunctional requirements of iSport, what iSport will do, and the constraints under which it must operate and how the system will react to external stimuli. This document is intended for both the stakeholders and the developers of the system and will be proposed to the clients for its approval.
%This SRS (Software Requirements Specification) document aims to identify the product--iSport whose software requirements are specified in this 
%document, including the revision or release number. And the scope of iSport is covered by this SRS, too, particularly if this SRS describes only 
%part of the system or a single subsystem.$>$

\section{Product Scope}
This software system will be a web based system for sports fans, professional athletes, and patients who are under recovering training. \\
\\
This system will be designed to maximize the exercising efficiency by providing tools to assist in checking and correcting user's wrong postures and recommending training courses customized for users, which would otherwise have to be expensive, time-consuming and labor intensive. By maximizing the user’s training efficiency and convenience the system will meet the needs of sports fans, athletes and injured patients while remaining easy to understand and use.\\
\\
More specifically, this system is designed to allow a user to imitate the standard exercising postures while observe and correct their mistakes simultaneously with the help of a website. \\
\\
The software will collect some professional courses in the database, including static and dynamic trainings which means doing exercise according to a set of images or a video and iSport will recommend suitable trainings for users on the basis of their training performance. Courses are classified into exercising courses and recovering courses, aiming to help athletes and patients respectively.\\
\\
Both visual and audio notification are used in every course of the system to provide eye-catching, user-friendly and clear instructions; the feedback of one's training is proposed once the training is over and the report can be browsed in the report page.\\
\\
The selection and deletion of one user's favorable course is supported in personal information webpage and one can comment training he/she has taken on comment webpage to provide suggestions to other users.\\
\\
 The personal information registering, changes is allowed via the application options. The system also contains a relational database containing a list of users, training images and videos.
 
\section{Intended Audience}
This Software Requirements document is intended for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developers who can review project’s capabilities and more easily understand where their efforts should be targeted to improve or add more features to it (design and code the application – it sets the guidelines for future development).
    \item Project testers can use this document as a base for their testing strategy as some bugs are easier to find using a requirements document. This way testing becomes more methodically organized.
   \item End users of this application who wish to read about what this project can do.
   \item Clients who delegate the software development to our team, and can check if their requirements are perfectly understood by the developers and whether the functional and nonfunctional requirements are entirely meet. And they can modify some requirements according to this document in later stage. 
   \item Project managers who translate the clients' requirement to the programmers and supervise them to implement the requirements mentioned in the documents and if the clients modify the requirements, the project managers have to negotiate the changes with the clients and modify the document.
   \item Marketing staff who are responsible to sale and prompt the software should be clear about what iSport can do, what iSport's advantages are, what iSport's competitive power is.
   \item Service staff who are responsible to solve the customer's problems, they have to know what iSport can do and feedback the technical problems to developers.
   \item Document writers who are responsible for writing the rest documents in later development stages should follow the requirements specified in this SRS.
\end{itemize}
The rest part of this SRS document contains the overall description of iSport, and iSport's specific, nonfunctional and other requirements which are shown in chapter\ref{Overall Description}, chapter\ref{Specific Requirements}, chapter\ref{Other Nonfunctional Requirements} and chapter\ref{Other Requirements} respectively.
We suggest the readers begin with the overview sections and proceeding through the sections that are most pertinent to them:
\begin{itemize} 
    \item Developers and project testers are recommended to focus on specific and nonfunctional requirements part because theses parts will lead them to build qualified, safe and satisfying application and theses parts are all related to coding (construction and verification stage).
    \item Clients, project managers and document writers should focus on the entire document since they are responsible for all the requirements specified in this paper.
    \item Marketing staff have to focus on the functional part of iSport.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}

 
\noindent 1. Memory: Server will have 500GB internal hard drive. Softwares and database cannot exceed this amount. System administrator must notice this limitation. And each user should follow the rule that the video data uploaded each time shall not be greater than 100M\\

 
\noindent 2. Language requirements: software must be multilingual, including the following languages: English, Chinese\\

 
\noindent 3. Number of user: each video uploaded must be one person. Each time this system can only deal with one person's data.\\

 
\section{User Documentation}

 
Along with this system: iSport, a user manual need to be written to help users understand how to operate the system. It would be written for nontechnical individuals and the level of content would differ considerably from a system administration guide, which is more detailed and complex. The user manual would follow common user documentation styles to be simple.\\

 
Trying to use step-by-step instructions for users who firstly log in to the website, by showing messaging structures, quick references, tips and glossary of terms.\\

 
User document can be written in HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or Portable Document Format (PDF) , which must describe the use of the software system.

 
\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}

 
It is assumed that the website will work correctly with every third-party operating
system and compatible across all of the major browsers.\\

 
Assumed that the web server always runs well without down or not responding.\\

 
ISport provides two kinds of classes for user to choose: fitness classes and rehabilitation classes.\\

 
Website visitors who have not been registered are only allowed to watch some demo videos, they are not allowed to upload their posture video data before registering.\\

 
In addition to test their posture and attend into courses, members are also allowed to update their information, but they have to log in first.\\


\chapter{Specific Requirements}
\label{Specific Requirements}
\section{External Interfaces Requirements}
\subsection{User Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item GUI Standard: Material Design is a design language that Google developed in 2014. Expanding on the "card" motifs that debuted in Google Now, Material Design uses more grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows.
    \item font Standard: Google Sans Font, agree with Material Design
    \item button Standard: Material Design
    \item color scheme: Dark, Light, changes in different system color scheme. Nowadays, every OS has at least 2 types color scheme, someone may prefer dark mode to be less distract.
    \item screen layout/resolution: adapt to user's device
    \item function, navigation links: in login page, user can go to homepage or register page by router. After entering homepage, user can see a navigation bar, in which user can jump to every sub-page without difficulty.
    \item message display: every dangerous change, such as changing password, username, phone number, the web page will show a message notification, on the righttop. If user does some wrong gestures, it will show a message notification and bell a sound to warn.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item supported device:\\
        \begin{itemize}
            \item mobile phones, including Android and iOS devices, with camera authorization.
            \item computers with camera or laptop, with camera authorization.
        \end{itemize}

    \item deployed device:\\
        A cloud web server in Ali Cloud, with 4 gigabytes RAM and dual-core CPU and 1TB disk.\\
        We deployed our web service, including database, backend on one server, the user amount now is not a large number, in some day if the user group grows larger and larger, we may use multiple servers and consider disturbed system.  
\end{itemize}
    Our product recall the interface between camera, to update data which contains the gestures user does to our server to analysis whether what the user does corresponds to criterion.
\subsection{Software Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Third part APIs we use
        \begin{itemize}
            \item OS: our service requires the OS grant the permission to recall camera of user divices.
            \item database: the database of our service is generally MySQL. Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an application programming interface (API) for the programming language Java, which defines how a client may access a database. It is a Java-based data access technology used for Java database connectivity. It is part of the Java Standard Edition platform, from Oracle Corporation. It provides methods to query and update data in a database, and is oriented towards relational databases. A JDBC-to-ODBC bridge enables connections to any ODBC-accessible data source in the Java virtual machine (JVM) host environment. To make jwt works correctly, we use a key-value dababase called redis, storing outdated token and blocking them to avoid a situation that a user just changed his password, but his token is still not outdated, because jwt cannot forces a token to be outdated.
            \item Springboot: the backend programm language is Java, our backend is based on Springboot and developed in form of microservice architecture. Microservice architecture is a development trend and arranges an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. With APIs provided by Springboot, the development goes efficiently and standard.
            \item PoseNet: our identification technologies is provided by a open-source project named PoseNet, PoseNet contains a standalone model called PoseNet, as well as some demos, for running real-time pose estimation in the browser using TensorFlow.js.
        \end{itemize}
    \item APIs we provide
        \begin{itemize}
            \item user register API\\
                This API provides the function that a new user becomes a new menber of iSport.\\
                API checks:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item whether the username has registered, 
                    \item whether the phone or email is empty
                \end{itemize}
                if pass all restrict, the new user owns his data in our database.
            \item user login API\\
                This API provides the function that a user launch a new session.\\
                API checks:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item whether this user has register.
                    \item the correction of password
                \end{itemize}
                if pass all restrict, the user now has logged in. He can begin to exercise.
            \item all courses API\\
                This API recieves a integer send by client, requests backend to return all courses with the type user type in. There two types of courses in iSport, one is rehabilitation course and the other is training course.
                API checks the type typed in by user, an integer, to return. Only 0 and 1 is valid, 1 is for rehabilitation, and 0 is for training.
            \item course content API\\ 
                This API recieves an ID of a course, and return all photography of this course, the provide a basic message to users.\\
                API checks the input, make sure that the input is not an empty input, then query in database, if the ID is invalid(e.g. not a course with this ID), the API throw an exception. If not, API respond with all photography about this course in database.
            \item get user name\\
                This API revives the ID of user, returns the username.\\
                API checks the validity of the input, if the ID is valid, API respond with the username.
            \item get user information\\
                This API recieves the ID of user, returns the user information.\\

\subsection{Communications Interfaces}
The data transferring in the Internet is video, and we choose the broadcast protocol is http-flv. This protocol is widely ued in the living industry, with the advantage of low-delay and ease to go through the firewall, it is also friendly to dispatch the rate of flow. \\ 
The session communication data is transferred in form of json. Json is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. Using jwt to authenticate can confirm safety of user session data. JSON Web Token (JWT) is an Internet standard for creating JSON-based access tokens that assert some number of claims. For example, a server could generate a token that has the claim "logged in as admin" and provide that to a client. The client could then use that token to prove that it is logged in as admin. The tokens are signed by one party's private key (usually the server's), so that both parties (the other already being, by some suitable and trustworthy means, in possession of the corresponding public key) are able to verify that the token is legitimate. The tokens are designed to be compact, URL-safe, and usable especially in a web-browser single-sign-on (SSO) context. JWT claims can be typically used to pass identity of authenticated users between an identity provider and a service provider, or any other type of claims as required by business processes. \\

\subsection{Data Modeling}
\subsubsection{Scenario Description}
First, \underline{users} need to register and input their information including \underline{account name}, \underline{password}, \underline{tel-number} and \underline{email address}. For users’ convenience, they can change their \underline{information} in later days.\\
\noindent Only after the user log in, he/she can use the \underline{function} of \underline{iSport}. For \underline{athletes} and \underline{sports fans}, they can view the \underline{exercise course} page and select the one they favor, adding the course to \underline{my course} page. The same is to the \underline{injured patients}, they can go to the \underline{recover course} page and add their favorite courses. Before the users select their \underline{courses}, they can go to the comment page to consider the \underline{comments} given by other users. \\
\noindent When the user decide to start the course, \underline{camera} will open and get the user’s \underline{postures}, meanwhile for \underline{dynamic courses}, the \underline{standard video} will start to play and for \underline{static course}, the \underline{images} will start to switch, then the user have to follow the video’s postures when exercising, at the same time, iSport will notify the user if his/her pass the posture and how to correct their postures. \\
\noindent When the course is finished, user will get a \underline{grade} given by iSport to feedback their performance for the whole course. Of course, they user will get a detailed \underline{report} in report page.

\noindent And for \underline{administrators}, they can upload new course to the iSport database.

\chapter{Other Nonfunctional Requirements}
\label{Other Nonfunctional Requirements}
\section{Performance Requirements}
\subsection{Precision}
\subsubsection{Input precision}
Phone number: 11 digits, will convert to string in database. \\
Email: numbers or letters, regex pattern: /\^ \space([A-Za-z0-9\_$\backslash$-$\backslash$.])+$\backslash$.([A-Za-z]\{2,4\})\$/. \\

\subsection{Time speciality requirement}
\subsubsection{Response time}
\begin{itemize}
    \item loading webpages time should be less than 1 second;
    \item operating webpage widget should be less than 0.5 second;
    \item when network is in good condition, the information loading time should be less than 0.5 second;
    \item when network is in good condition, user comment and report should be up to date in 2 seconds after user add a new one.
    \item adopt message middleware, update should be async, do not affect the main process UI response.
    \item all pages updating should be async, and the priority of character loading is larger than photo's, time of updating character should be less than 0.1 second, time of updating photos should be less than 0.2 second.
    \item all the page updating time should be less than 1 second.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Input and output requirement}
\subsubsection{User register input}
data name: user register input data
implication: for usr registration, including user name and password
data type: string
constraint: consist of English letters and numbers, no special characters allowed. The length of username is between 6 and 12, password is between 6 and 18.
\subsubsection{User comments input}
data name: user comments input data
implication: for user comments 
data type: string
constraint: length of comments should be at least 10 words and less than 500 words.

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}
The frontend and backend should both check the input data to ensure the user input won't cause a system crash.\\
Some sensitive data, including phone numbers and email address is store in database, once divulged, the user may be affected by harass message. The database authorization should be granted with caution.\\ 
Some days the system should be deployed in disturbed system, maintaining consistency by consensus algorithm, avoiding data safety, minimize the danger of dropping data caused by crash.\\

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
\subsection{Flexibility Requirement}
We use iterative development, in a week, for a development cycle, check every three days to discuss the progress of the development, after the end of each iteration to joint test of existing functions, to ensure that when the former system can run normally after discussing the development of the next increment details and concrete tasks, we carried out in accordance with the system module division of labor, each member is responsible for the view, model, control device and block chain one of four modules or some modules of all the work, each mold piece in have different emphases, members based on their ability to select the corresponding module development.\\

Docking test will be conducted between modules after completion of development\\

The development mode of test-driven development is adopted. After the development task is determined, the corresponding unit test is written first. The code written during functional development needs to pass the unit test written at the beginning to ensure the writing efficiency and quality of the code.\\

Git is adopted for project management, and corresponding records are kept for each function update and version iteration. If the plan needs to be changed or improved, the most appropriate version can be selected to continue development based on the original development.\\

This approach reduces the additional development effort due to planned changes and allows us to be more flexible with the changes we encounter during development.\\

We will adopt a backward compatible development plan in the development process, that is, our system can be well adapted to the new environment in the future, and the client supports a variety of system adaptations, and can work well on different types of devices.\\

The relevant interface information of the system is stored in the database. If the software interface of the foreign department changes during the system operation, the content in the database can be modified to adapt to the change\\

\subsection{Reliability Requirement}
The entire system will be distributed in the form of a database so that each participating node can get a copy of the complete database.
Unless more than 51\% of nodes in the entire system can be controlled at the same time, changes to the database on a single node are not valid and cannot affect the data content on other nodes.

\subsection{Usability Requirement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The unified interface style and friendly user interaction design make it more convenient for users to acquire
The information you want.
    \item Reduce the user's learning cost as far as possible, convenient operation, reasonable operation process, the completion of the operation when the unified standard prompt information.
    \item Support no computer use experience, less computer use experience and have more computer use experience users can easily use the system
    \item The system has a certain fault-tolerant and anti-interference ability, in the non-hardware fault or non-communication fault, the system can ensure the normal operation, and there are enough prompt information to help users effectively and correctly complete the task.
    \item The system has some flexibility, can prompt the user how to operate
    \item The system is universal, easy to learn and practical
    \item The site features fewer features and fewer redundant and annoying features.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Maintainability Requirement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maintainability is the ability to modify problems or defects in existing system functionality without affecting the rest of the system.
When developers create and design system architectures, they must consider the following elements in order to improve system maintainability: low-coupling, high-in-aggregate systems.
    \item This system will adopt strict software engineering specification to develop, and adopt good design mode to ensure the low coupling and high cohesion between the modules.
    \item All the code of the system will be detailed comments, for all the code of the system, we will generate detailed technical documentation.
For the system development process may appear error, we will document the way a detailed list of error and corresponding error message.
    \item Relevant documentation should be clear, complete and consistent
    \item At the same time, it should have good function, data extensibility and adaptability to the environment
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Expandability Requirement}
After the completion of the system, no major changes should be made to the existing system or affect the whole system
In this way, it is convenient to add corresponding functions according to the needs of users in the later maintenance process without affecting the normal operation of other function modules of the system.
In addition, all documentation should be detailed and complete so that other recipients or new developers can quickly learn about the system and properly update and enhance it.

\subsection{Stability Requirement}
The website can normally complete all functional requirements, and ensure that the server runs for a long time without obstacles.
Fault repair time is generally controlled within 3 hours, unless there is a vicious attack, virus damage, insufficient system resources, hardware failure, operating system crash network interruption, do not allow memory leak.
The system is required to be able to withstand the warning storm and the impact of the large amount of data, not memory overflow and other phenomena.

\subsection{Operational Environment Convertibility Requirements}
This web page can be self-adapted to normal operation on the mobile phone.


\chapter{Other Requirements}
\label{Other Requirements}
%$<$Define any other requirements not covered elsewhere in the SRS. This might 
%include database requirements, internationalization requirements, legal 
%requirements, reuse objectives for the project, and so on. Add any new sections 
%that are pertinent to the project.$>$

\section{Data Dictionary Requirements}
A data dictionary, or metadata repository, as defined in the IBM Dictionary of Computing[10], is a "centralized repository of information about data such as meaning, relationships to other data, origin, usage and format.”\\

\noindent The primary goal of our data dictionary is to allow users to better understand the data in the data
warehouse. 
The Data Dictionary should be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accessible – For both reading and updating.
\item Reliable – The information in the data dictionary must be kept up to date and managed by the appropriate data stewards.
\item Robust – The richer the information, the more useful. Must also be searchable.
\item Central – One and only one data dictionary.
\end{itemize}
%The main requirements in the remainder of this document intend to describe:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item What information we will store about the data elements in the data dictionary.
%\item How the information will be stored.
%\item How it will be accessed.
%\item How it will be updated.
%\item Other considerations.
%\end{itemize}
The process of building out information in the data dictionary will last for as long as the data warehouse is in existence. It is expected that as clients use the system, especially Subject Matter Experts/Data Stewards, they will update the Data Dictionary as needed with new and useful information.\\
\subsection{Data Dictionary Example}
\noindent An example is as follows:
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
%\section{Appendix A: Glossary}
%%see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary
%$<$Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the SRS, including 
%acronyms and abbreviations. You may wish to build a separate glossary that spans 
%multiple projects or the entire organization, and just include terms specific to 
%a single project in each SRS.$>$

%\section{Appendix A: Analysis Models}
%$<$Optionally, include any pertinent analysis models, such as data flow 
%diagrams, class diagrams, state-transition diagrams, or entity-relationship 
%diagrams.$>$
%
%\section{Appendix B: To Be Determined List}
%$<$Collect a numbered list of the TBD (to be determined) references that remain 
%in the SRS so they can be tracked to closure.$>$
